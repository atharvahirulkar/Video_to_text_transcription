every presentation is an opportunity to make an impression you can either use your pitch to build credibility engagement and buy in or below the chance to share your story in a way that sells no matter how compelling your message is if you don't get to your audience's attention in the first minute you will miss the momentum you need to get them on board and to stay there that first minute is when you are supposed to establish your command of the room and the topic build Rapid and signal that you are come so the audience can just relax you've got this but this rarely happens your other presentation openers I hear over and over again hello thanks for being here here there thanks for bearing with me today let me start by apologizing for no no no a present opening is your promise to your listeners these status promise that this meeting is going to be boring at best and a mess at most a great introduction promise is the audience that this presentation will be engaging innovative educational and if you are lucky maybe even inspiring to do that you need to stop being so polite and start being more passionate from the moment you open your mouth while attempting to put weeks into building it spend days making sure all the numbers add up and wake up at night worrying about whether you have incorporated on the latest changes from your team you are better of spending a few of those minutes making sure that your start is as strong solid and ceiling at the rest of your presentation
